            Nezuko is a petite young girl with fair skin, visibly large,
            prominent fangs, and sharp, stiletto nails with a base color of
            light pink and ombre fading to a red-pinkish color at the end where
            they point. Her hair is long, black, and wavy. It reaches just below
            her waist, turning a flame-orange color as it passes her elbows, and
            appears to be crimped into large, straight ridges, worn side-swept
            drastically to her left. She has soft-looking, pale pink eyes that
            appear a lighter color around the rims of their irises, slanted
            downward toward the sides of her face and framed by notably long
            eyelashes, the pupils of which can appear slit as she transforms. In
            the manga, Nezuko can sometimes be shown with more than one bow.
            According to Tanjiro Kamado, Nezuko was known as a great beauty in
            their home town.[3]

            Giyu always wears a stoic and unbothered expression on his face. He
            has a reserved personality and a strong sense of justice with no
            tolerance towards those who don't know their own limitations and
            throw away their lives.[6] Despite letting Nezuko Kamado live due to
            Tanjiro Kamado's persistence, he shows zero hesitation when killing
            other demons and has no respect or mercy towards them like most
            Demon Slayers.[7] Even so, Giyu violated the Demon Slayer Corps'
            code of conduct when he protected Nezuko during Shinobu's attempt to
            kill her. This implies that he doesn't completely despise demons as
            some other Hashira do, and is willing to make an exception for a
            demon by letting them live if they don't kill and eat humans. This
            shows that he is more pragmatic in dealing with demons rather
            letting his hatred cloud his judgement.

            Urokodaki is a set-up character. This means that your playstyle
            should include using Master's Wisdom every time you can. For
            instance, when your enemy is lying on the floor, put a trap near
            him. Then go all the way around them and attack, leading the
            opponent to your trap. Master's Wisdom is excellent for extending
            combos, but avoid making it your first confirmed hit. It counts as a
            heavy attack, which will limit your combo faster than the other
            special abilities or regular combos. Contrary to other characters'
            guard skills, Master's Wisdom doesn't make Urokodaki invincible
            while he's performing it. Be careful when you are setting your
            traps.

            Like every other fighter, Rengoku has three special attacks using
            the skill button, and one Ultimate Art. His moves are based on flame
            breathing techniques and his skills have an incredible range. His
            skill attacks are the following ones: Fifth Form: Flame Tiger (skill
            button): a series of attacks in form of a tiger that has an
            outstanding range and deals massive damage. Third Form: Blazing
            Universe (skill button + tilting the left stick to any direction): a
            dash-in slash that makes the enemy bounce. You can keep attacking
            after it. Second Form: Rising Scorching Sun (hold guard button +
            skill button): a series of hits that launch the enemy into the air.
            You can't follow this move with a combo, so use it as a finisher.
            Plus, it makes Rengoku invincible for a few seconds. His Ultimate
            Art: Ninth Form: Rengoku (right trigger when you have at least one
            special bar): his signature move is an explosive attack with all his
            strength.

            Sabito was a serious young man who believed that all of his actions
            should be becoming of a man. He was seen as a ruthless mentor during
            his time training Tanjiro Kamado, who was always quick to point out
            his flaws and refused to acknowledge him as a man. When asked about
            defeating the Hand Demon, Sabito appeared to have a pessimistic view
            on conflicts, saying he believed that no matter how hard someone
            tries it will never be enough to take the beast down.
